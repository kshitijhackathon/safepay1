## üöÄ Project Overview

SafePay is a comprehensive fraud detection and prevention platform that uses advanced machine learning algorithms to protect users from common UPI payment scams. The application provides real-time risk assessment of QR codes, voice calls, video content, and text messages to identify potential threats before financial transactions occur.

## üîê Key Features

- **ML-Powered QR Scanner**: 94% accurate risk assessment for QR codes with direct UPI app integration
- **Voice Scam Detection**: Analyzes call recordings for fraud indicators with voice-focused AI processing
- **Video Analysis**: Identifies scam videos through comprehensive visual, audio, and text analysis
- **Text & WhatsApp Scam Check**: Detects phishing attempts and scam patterns in messages
- **3D Fraud Map**: Interactive visualization showing fraud hotspots across regions
- **Two-Step Verification Flow**: Safety verification and transaction confirmation screens
- **UPI Deep Linking**: Seamless redirection to payment apps (GPay, PhonePe, Paytm)
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Layered security with OTP, PIN, and biometric options

## üíª Technology Stack

## üîß Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Replit account for cloud deployment
- Groq API key or OpenAI API key

### Replit Installation

1. Fork this Repl
2. Add your environment variables in the Secrets tab:

   - `GROQ_API_KEY`: Your Groq API key
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (for audio transcription)
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: A secure random string
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your database URL (provided by Replit)

3. Click the Run button to start the development server

### Port Configuration

The application uses a standardized port configuration:

- Main Server: 5000 (Express)
- QR ML Service: 8081 (FastAPI/Flask)
- Voice/Text ML Service: 8082 (FastAPI)
- Video ML Service: 8083 (FastAPI)

For detailed port configuration documentation, see [PORT_CONFIGURATION.md](PORT_CONFIGURATION.md).

### Deployment

For detailed deployment instructions, including port mapping, environment variables, and file size optimization, please see [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).

### Local Development with VS Code

For detailed instructions on setting up a local development environment with VS Code, please see [VSCODE_DEVELOPMENT.md](VSCODE_DEVELOPMENT.md).

### Docker Setup

For containerized development, you can use Docker:

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up

# Or build and run in background
docker-compose up -d
```

## üì± Usage Flow

1. **Scan QR Code**: Use the scanner to capture UPI payment QR codes
2. **Review Safety Verification**: View merchant details and comprehensive risk assessment
3. **Confirm Transaction**: Review payment amount and beneficiary details
4. **Select Payment App**: Choose between GPay, PhonePe, or Paytm
5. **Complete Payment**: Process transaction directly in your preferred UPI app
