To migrate from OpenAI API to Groq API in your Replit project, follow these steps:

1. Update Environment Variables
Prompt to Replit:
"Add GROQ_API_KEY to Secrets (Environment Variables)"

Steps:

Get API key from Groq Cloud

In Replit:

Click Tools â†’ Secrets

Add:
Key: GROQ_API_KEY
Value: [your-api-key]

2. Install Groq Client
Update your requirements.txt or install via Shell:

bash
pip install groq
3. Code Changes
Replace OpenAI code with Groq equivalents:

Before (OpenAI):
python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
After (Groq):
python
from groq import Groq

client = Groq(api_key=os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY"))

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="mixtral-8x7b-32768",  # Example model
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
  temperature=0.5,
  max_tokens=1024
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
4. Key Differences to Address
Models: Use Groq-supported models (e.g., mixtral-8x7b-32768, llama2-70b-4096).

Parameters: Some parameters may differ (check Groq Docs).

Response Structure: Verify the JSON structure in responses.

5. Common Groq Models
python
# For high-speed inference:
model = "mixtral-8x7b-32768"  

# For longer context windows:
model = "llama2-70b-4096"
6. Error Handling
Add checks for Groq-specific errors:

python
try:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(...)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Groq API Error: {e}")
7. Testing
Test all API calls thoroughly.

Validate output formatting.

Monitor Groq's rate limits (different from OpenAI).

8. Cleanup
Remove OpenAI dependencies:

bash
pip uninstall openai
Delete OpenAI API key from Replit Secrets.

9. Documentation
Refer to Groq's official documentation for advanced usage:
