## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of SafePay extremely seriously, especially given its financial security focus. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been addressed by the maintainers.
2. **Email the details to** [safepay-security@hackazard.com](mailto:safepay-security@hackazard.com) with the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)
3. **Allow time for response** - We will acknowledge your report within 24 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.
4. **Responsible disclosure** - Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will acknowledge your contribution (unless you request anonymity).

## Financial Security Considerations

SafePay deals with sensitive financial information and UPI transaction security. Therefore:

1. **Never store actual UPI credentials** in the application.
2. **Do not implement real payment processing** without proper security review.
3. **Always use secure communication channels** (HTTPS) for all API requests.
4. **Implement proper data masking** for sensitive information in logs and UI.
5. **Regularly audit all payment and authentication flows** for security vulnerabilities.

## Security Best Practices for Developers

When contributing to this project, please follow these security best practices:

1. **Never commit sensitive credentials** such as API keys, passwords, or session secrets to the repository.
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration.
3. **Keep dependencies updated** to avoid known vulnerabilities.
4. **Validate all user inputs** to prevent injection attacks.
5. **Implement proper authentication and authorization** checks.
6. **Use secure, modern cryptographic methods** for sensitive operations.
7. **Follow the principle of least privilege** when granting access to resources.

## Security Features

SafePay implements several security features:

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: OTP, PIN, and biometric options.
2. **ML-Based Fraud Detection**: Advanced machine learning algorithms to detect scams.
3. **Groq & OpenAI Integration**: AI-powered fraud detection and analysis.
4. **Secure Database Access**: Drizzle ORM with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
5. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation with Zod schema validation.
6. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks on authentication endpoints.
7. **Real-time Risk Assessment**: Dynamic evaluation of transaction security.

## Machine Learning Security

1. **Model Security**: Protect ML models from tampering or extraction.
2. **Training Data Privacy**: Ensure no personal identifiable information (PII) is used in training.
3. **Adversarial Attack Prevention**: Monitor and mitigate potential adversarial inputs.
4. **Explainability**: Maintain transparency in risk assessment decisions.
5. **Model Performance Monitoring**: Regular evaluation of model accuracy and bias.

## Privacy Considerations

1. **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data for the application.
2. **User Consent**: Clearly inform users about data usage.
3. **Secure Storage**: Encrypt sensitive user data at rest.
4. **Secure Transmission**: Encrypt all data in transit.
5. **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies.

## Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

We regularly scan our dependencies for vulnerabilities using automated tools. Contributors are encouraged to run vulnerability scans locally before submitting pull requests.
